4.Write a C program to  search a specified eleent in array of random elements.
if the search  is successful then,  the program should  display the following
1. Search is successful 
2. the position of first occurance
3. the position of the last occurance 

Example 1
given array  {11,22,33,33,66,55,88,11,33,11}; and key ==11
o/p   
Search Successfull                                                                                                  
The first occuracne of the key is = 1                                                                               
The last occuracne of the key is = 10    

Example 2
given array   {22,33,33,66,55,88,11,33,11,55}; and key =33
o/p
Search Successfull                                                                                                  
The first occuracne of the key is = 2                                                                               
The last occuracne of the key is = 8     

Example 3
given array   {22,33,33,66,55,88,11,33,11,55}; and key =88
o/p
Search Successfull                                                                                                 
The first occuracne of the key is = 6                                                                              
The last occuracne of the key is = 6    

Example 4
given array   {22,33,33,66,55,88,11,33,11,55}; and key =99
o/p
Search Failure
